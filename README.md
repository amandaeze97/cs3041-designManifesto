### About Me

Hi! I'm a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute currently studying Computer Science. I am from Lagos, Nigeria, but grew up in Southern California. When I am not doing schoolwork, I like dance, draw, write poetry, and hang out with friends.

This page includes some of the projects I have been working on in my Human Computer Interaction class, as well as some of my concluding thoughts on what a good design looks like and how it can be reached.

### My Design Process

>#### "There are three responses to a piece of design – yes, no, and WOW! Wow is the one to aim for.”  - Milton Glaser


When it comes to creating a product with the hope of making the user's experience better, it is important to follow the 4 step design process:
1. **Brainstorming**
   - this can be done using the 5 design sheet methodology
     - **sheet 1**: brainstorming sheet *(ideate, filter, categorize, combine, and refine question)*
     - **sheets 2, 3, 4**: design sheets *(layout, information, focus, operations, and discussion)*
     - **sheet 5**: realization sheet *(layout, information, focus, operations, and detail)*
2. **Prototyping**
   - is generally divided into two separate categories: low- and high-fidelity prototyping
     - low-fidelity = involves the use of basic models or examples of the product being tested, such as storyboarding and sketching
     - high-fidelity = looks and operates closer to the finished product, such as a 3D plastic model with movable parts
3. **User Testing**
   - refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users, to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product. If feedback is neutral/negative or the value proposition isn’t clear to the user, revise your prototype and run another round of testing.
4. **Finalization**
   - uses the feedback provided by the users to complete any changes that need to need to be done and produce the final product

>#### BRAINSTORMING

Brainstorming and idea processing was what started each project. For Example, in the Design for a Another World, our idea process was what took the majority of time. This was because the idea had to have a distinct purpose. Not only did I learn how to solve problems in regards to the idea, but to make sure I am solving the right problems. We would know which problems to solve by watching how users interact with the problem at hand. In certain situations, we would not tell the user what the problem was and would let them figure it out on their own. In some cases, the problem we thought would be the main focus would not actually be the one. The user could fine an entirely new problem in the starting stages of our process. We also had to make sure that our idea were completed within a deadline which would dictate which scopes of the projects were attainable at certain points.

>#### PROTOTYPING

During the creation of the projects with my various team members througout the term, there were multiple times when time and energy could have been saved, if we had taken the time necessary to prototype our ideas before implementing them. I noticed that in the projects where I dedicated significant time to sketching and creating mock-up versions of the product, the quality of the final product was much higher. I had more time to spend on the implementation and focus on the details. 

To create prototypes, I first created paper sketched, which were made into paper prototypes, and lastly into mock-up versions of a more design focused model. Below are the three examples that I just listed, which were used for the Design for Others project regarding the rebuilding of Technocopia's website.

>#### USER TESTING
                   
After developing multple prototypes, my group members and I would distribute them to outside members and ask them to test out the prototypes. We would ask them questions such as what they like, what they wish, and what if? This would give us both directions as to what is working and what can be improved. User feedback in some cases would entirely change the direction of our project, which is why it is important to get feedback as soon as possible. Feedback can't be done to early though, because the users at the beginning do not usually know what they want. Which is why we as the designers/engineers need to create multiple ideas/sketches/protypes. We can then tweek our product once the general mass of users has come to a consensus.

>#### FINALIZATION

With the combination of brainsotmringour previous design steps, we can create an intricate, well-designed, and thoroughly tested product to be used. The design process is transferable to any problem. This is true, because at the start of the class, we were working on a mobile application design for a workshop, and then ended with creating a virtual reality experience. We made a chat-bot that would help those who wanted to know more about gun access, but before that we created a webpage that would visualize the number of drivers that got into accidents per state in the United States. All of these are different problems, but were built using the same process, which is why each one came out with a successful solution.

### Good Design, Bad Design
![Image](images/good-or-bad.png)

The objective of this assignment was to learn how to tell wether a design was a good or bad one. It helped me to start thinking about the designs around me and how how people interact with the digital world. Below are links to the medium posts about my ideas on some of the good and bad designs of the WPI website.

**Medium Posts**: [Good Design](https://medium.com/@amanda.c.eze/wpi-website-good-design-a26cd103796f) and [Bad Design](https://medium.com/@amanda.c.eze/wpi-website-bad-design-2d8abb710589).

### Design for Others
![Image](images/mobile-friendly.png)

This project involved a group written Medium Post. We were tasked with redesigning a website of a local Worcester business for the demographic of high school students. Furthermore, we were required to design for mobile devices. We decided to redesign the website for Technocopia, a local makerspace in Worcester, to encourage more local teens to learn valuable design design skills while also encouraging them to express themselves through making. Technocopia’s existing website was also very poorly optimized for mobile phones, which factored heavily into our decision. Below is the link to the medium post that discusses our design process with pictures of our designs and user testing.

### Design for Understanding

Design for Understanding was a project focused on the different ways to use visual methods to map data from a dataset to communicate information for two different end goals: (1) one for the goal of clear communication and reasoning and (2) the persuasive communication and storytelling. My group and I chose to use the dataset titled “Bad Drivers” in the US from FiveThirtyEight’s story, [Dear Mona, Which State Has the Worst Drivers?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/). The source repository of our data can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bad-drivers/bad-drivers.csv). Our final visualizations can be viewed [here](https://users.wpi.edu/~eekirschner/BadDriversCS3041.html). Below is the link to the medium post that discusses our design process with pictures of our designs and user testing.

### Design for Well-being
![Image](images/emotions.jpg)

The Design for Well-being assignment was focused on what it means for our computer devices to be attentive to us in ways that haven’t in the past. We were to design an application that responded to user emotions to promote well-being. One of the design requirements for this assignment was to make use of the Affectiva library. Affectiva library makes it easy to use emotions as captured by a users webcam in a web application. My team and I decided to focus on eliciting the emotion of joy and providing the user with a tool they can use to cheer themselves up with. Below is the link to the medium post that discusses our design process with pictures of our designs and user testing.

### Design for Another World
![Image](images/VR.png)

For the final project, Design for Another World, my group and I explored virtual reality to consider what it will be like when computation can transport us to another place. Our objective was to design for horror. The idea was to scare or instill fear in the user. While seemingly a horrible goal, studies show that being scared can be cathartic as there is a huge release of emotions. We decided to insert our concept instilling fear into an already established model from A-Frame. After scouring through, we determined the museum model best suited our concept. Our final idea was to create a haunted/corrupted museum that intended to scare. We made use of images, lighting, and music to accomplish this goal.

### Final Thoughts

Some of the biggest challenges I faced was being unfamilair with some of the new software and libraries used in class such as FlowXO, Affectiva, and AFrame. Since I did not know how to use some of these applications, it took me longer to fully understadn how to use them. Most of the coding languages used in this class I was already familiar with, however I did get to understadn the JavaScript coding language better. Throughout my time in this class, it was nice to be in groups of 3-4 people because it made communication easier and if one perso did not know how to use a particular software, the other team members could help. This was he case for me and I was very lucky to have extremely helpful classmates who were willing to take the time to teach me new things. 

In my future projects I hope to be able to integrate as many of the tools I used to create a product that really focuses on giving the ultimate experience to users. I really enjoyed being able to explore different realms of the human computer interaction, and this class really spiked an interest and passion in me for design and UX.
