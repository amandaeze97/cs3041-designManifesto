## Amanda Ezeobiejesi

Hello! I am a student currently studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I am from Lagos, Nigeria, but grew up in Southern California.

This page includes some of the projects I have been working on in my Human Computer Interaction class, as well as some of my concluding thoughts on what a good design looks like and how it can be reached. 

Aside from design relating to user's experience, I like dance, draw, write poetry, and hang out with friends.
