Hello! I am a student currently studying Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I am from Lagos, Nigeria, but grew up in Southern California.

This page includes some of the projects I have been working on in my Human Computer Interaction class, as well as some of my concluding thoughts on what a good design looks like and how it can be reached. 

Aside from design relating to user's experience, I like dance, draw, write poetry, and hang out with friends.

### Good Design, Bad Design

The objective of this assignment was to learn how to tell wether a design wasb a good or bad one. It helped me to start thinking about the designs around me and how how people interact with the digital world.

### Final Thoughts

Some of the biggest challenges I faced was being unfamilair with some of the new software and libraries used in class such as FlowXO, Affectiva, and AFrame. Since I did not know how to use some of these applications, it took me longer to fully understadn how to use them. Most of the coding languages used in this class I was already familiar with, however I did get to understadn the JavaScript coding language better. Throughout my time in this class, it was nice to be in groups of 4 because it made communication easier and if one perso did not know how to use a particular software, the other team members could help. This was he case for me and I was very lucky to have extremely helpful classmates who were willing to take the time to teach me new things. 

In my future projects I hope to be able to integrate as many of the tools I learned to create a product that really focuses on giving the ultimate experience to users. I really enjoyed being able to explore different realms of the human computer interaction, and this class really spiked an interest and passion in me for design and UX.
